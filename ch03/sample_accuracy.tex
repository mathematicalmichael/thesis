\section{Accuracy of Sample-Based Inversion}\label{sec:ch03-sample}

How does the new approach compare? What role does the KDE play in the error?
Focus on linear problems. One or two examples (perhaps use that skew-map with 1 and 2 and 4).

\subsection{A Sample-Based Solution}\label{eq:sampleskew}

Here we solve the problems in Examples~\ref{ex:skewness} and~\ref{ex:3dmap}, except in the framework of the Sample-Based Inversion outlined in \ref{sec:ch02-sample}.
Effect of Skewness appears to be mitigated.
