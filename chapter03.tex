\section{Skewness and Information Content}
Review.

\section{Skewness and Accuracy of Set-Based Inversion}


\
\section{Skewness and Accuracy of Sample-Based Inversion}

How does the new approach compare? What role does the KDE play in the error?
Focus on linear problems. One or two examples (perhaps use that skew-map with 1 and 2 and 4).

\
\section{Software Contributions}

Talk about the BET module that computes metrics.
Discuss testing, show sample of usage (disconnected from skewness, high-level).

\
\section{Numerical Results and Analysis}

Pick an ODE problem and show how the results look like (assimilating as many data points as inputs, if using time-series model). 

Our goal in this section is to provide a set of examples that demonstrate these two approaches, their ``solutions.''
Exponential Decay, uncertain initial condition and rate. Fix two measurement times. No OED discussion.

Show visualization of solution on voronoi-mesh vs. 2D density. 

This is going to set up the stage nicely.
What if we had more measurements to incorporate? Discuss how the distributions we imposed as our observed were kind of a little disingenuous since they were based on single measurements. Well, rather, they represent the answer to a different question.
