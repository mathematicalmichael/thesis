We provide a summary of the notation, definitions, problem-formulation, and assumptions considered in this proposal. 
For more details,  we refer the interested reader to \cite{BES12, BE13, BET+14}. 

Let $u$ be the solution to a model, perhaps of a physical system such as the amount of contaminant in a subsurface. 
Let $\param$ represent a parameter into such a model, e.g. the permeability of the medium in the subsurface through which a contaminant is spreading.
Such parameters are often uncertain and we begin the quantification of uncertainty by identifying a set of possible parameters $\pspace$.
Since different $\param \in \pspace$ can lead to different model solutions, we write $u\lam$ to make this dependence explicit.

Generally, we cannot observe the entire solution $u(\param)$, and instead are able to observe data related to some quantities of interest (QoI), defined as functionals of $u\lam$ (e.g. the contaminant levels at a specific well at a particular time).
We let $\qoi$ denote the QoI map from the solution space of the model to the space of observable data. 
Then, given $\param \in \pspace$, we obtain $u\lam$ and compute $\qoi(u\lam)$ to get the QoI data predicted by the model.
Clearly, the QoI map depends on $\param$ through the dependency of $u$ on $\param$, so we write $\qlam$ to simplify our notation.
We assume this map is at least piece-wise differentiable.	
The data space $\dspace \subset \RR^d$ is defined as the range of the QoI map $\qoi$, i.e. 
\[
\dspace = \qoi(\pspace).
\]

Let $\pborel$ and $\dborel$ denote (the Borel) $\sigma$-algebras on $\pspace$ and $\dspace$, respectively.
The map $\qoi$ between measurable spaces $(\pspace, \pborel)$ and $(\dspace, \dborel)$ is immediately measurable by the smoothness assumption. 
Then, equipping $\pspace$ and $\dspace$ with (volume) measures $\pmeas$ and $\dmeas$, respectively, is the final ingredient for defining probability density functions (pdfs) on the measure spaces $(\pspace, \pborel, \pmeas)$ and $(\dspace, \dborel, \dmeas)$.
In practice, $\pmeas$ and $\dmeas$ are often taken to be Lebesgue volume measures when $\pspace$ and $\dspace$ are finite-dimensional~\cite{BET+14, BJW18}.

\subsection{Problem Formulation and Solution}
This now brings us to our central definition:

\begin{defn}[Inverse Problem]\label{defn:consistency}
Given a probability measure $\observed$ on $(\dspace, \dborel)$, absolutely continuous with respect to $\dmeas$, the \emph{inverse problem} is to determine a probability measure $\updatedP$ on $(\pspace, \pborel)$, absolutely continuous with respect to $\pmeas$, 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:inverse-problem}
\updatedP(\qoi^{-1}(E)) = \int_{\qoi^{-1}(E)} \updated \lam \, d\pmeas = \int_E \observed \q \, d\dmeas = \observed(E), \; \forall \; E \in \mathcal{B}_\dspace.
\end{equation} 

Here, 
\begin{equation*}
\updated = \frac{d\updatedP}{d\pmeas} \;\text{ and }\; \observed = \frac{d\observedP}{d\dmeas}
\end{equation*}
are the Radon-Nikodym derivatives (i.e., pdfs) of $\updatedP$ and $\observed$, respectively. 
Any probability measure $\initialP$ satisfying \eqref{eq:inv} is referred to as a \emph{consistent solution} to the inverse problem, and \eqref{eq:inv} is referred to as the \emph{consistency condition}.
\end{defn}

In measure-theoretic terms, $\updatedP$ is a pull-back measure of $\observed$.
From the perspective of a forward problem, we seek $\updatedP$ such that its push-forward measure is equivalent to $\observed$. 
In other words, the solution we seek to the inverse problem is constrained by a forward problem. 
Below, we introduce some vocabulary involved in the formulation and solution of the stochastic inverse problem.

\begin{defn}[Observed Density]\label{defn:obsden}
The density $\observed$ in \eqref{eq:inv} represents the uncertainty in QoI data and is referred to as the \emph{observed density}.
\end{defn}

To construct $\updated$ satisfying \eqref{eq:inv}, we adopt a Bayesian perspective of combining prior beliefs with data. 

\begin{defn}[Initial Distribution]\label{defn:initial}
The density $\initial$ is used to represent any prior beliefs about parameters before evidence is taken into account, and is referred to as the \emph{prior density}.
\end{defn}

Finally, to construct $\updated$, we ``push-forward'' the prior beliefs using the QoI map to compare to the evidence provided by $\observed$. 
In other words, we first solve a forward problem to construct a solution to the inverse problem. 
To make this precise, we use the following:

\begin{defn}[Predicted Distribution]\label{defn:predicted}
The push-forward density of $\initial$ under the map $\qoi$ is denoted simply as $\predicted$. 
It is given as the Radon-Nikodym derivative (with respect to $\dmeas$) of the push-forward probability measure defined by 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:predicted}
\predictedP^Q (E)  = P_\pspace \left ( \qoi^{-1}(E) \right ), \; \forall \; E \in \dborel.
\end{equation}
\end{defn}

These definitions are combined to form the \emph{updated density}, originally derived in \cite{BJW18}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:update}
\updated \lam = \initial \lam \frac{\observed \q }{\predicted \q }, \; \param \in \pspace.
\end{equation}

Any probability measure that satisfies Equation~\ref{eq:inverse-problem} is considered a consistent solution to the stochastic inverse problem.

In the event that the map $Q$ is a bijection, then the consistency condition (\ref{defn:consistency}) defines a unique measure $\PP$ on $\pspace$ given the specification of an observed density.
However, there are many applications of interest where the quantitiy of interest map $\qoi$ fails to be a bijection, either due to differences in the dimensions of the parameter and data spaces, nonlinearities inherent in the model itself, or both. 

The map $\qoi$ impacts the structure of the update, since both densities on $(\dspace, \dborel)$ are evaluated at $\qlam$.
Moreover, the underlying data space $\dspace$ itself depends on $\qoi$.
The specific nuances of this relationship are discussed in Sections~\ref{que:impact} and \ref{res:impact} in greater detail.
Here, we simply note that the construction of \eqref{eq:update} requires only the forward-problem construction of $\predicted$, since $\initial$ and $\observed$ are given \emph{a priori}.
Some additional properties are summarized below along with some critical assumptions necessary to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of a update of the form given by \eqref{eq:inv}.
