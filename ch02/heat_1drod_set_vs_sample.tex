\subsection{1D Heat Rod}\label{ex:heat-set-sample}

We demonstrate that the same principles at play in Example\ref{ex:decay-set-sample} apply to another nonlinear problem.
The set-- and sample--based methods are functionally equivalent solution methods which leverage the same foundational measure--theoretic principles.
Here, the quantification of uncertainty is for the thermal conductivity properties of a material based on temperature data collected after heating it in an experiment.


Consider the one-dimensional heat equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on the unit interval:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot ( \kappa \nabla T) + f(x), \quad & x\in (0,1), t\in (0,1) \\
f(x) = A e^\frac{- (x-0.5)^2}{w} \Chi_{[0,0.5]}(t)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\emph{Alternative setup: }

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
\rho c \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot ( \kappa \nabla T) + f(x,t), & \text{if } x\in \Omega \\
\frac{\partial T}{\partial \vec{n}} = 0 & \text{if } x\in \partial \Omega
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega = (0,1)\times (0,1)$ is the space-time interior and $f(x,t) = A e^\frac{- (x-0.5)^2}{w} \Chi_{[0,0.5]}(t)$.

Here, we interpret the following problem as heating the middle of an infinitesimally thin unit-length rod for half a second with a heat-source modeled by a Gaussian curve with amplitude $A=50$ and variance of $w=0.05$.
This heat source is turned on at the beginning of the experiment and turned off halfway through the 1-second duration.

The rod is subdivided in two, and each half has an uncertain thermal diffusivity $\kappa \in [0.01, 0.2]$.
This yields a two-dimensional parameter space $\param = (\param_1, \param_2) \in [0.01, 0.2]^2$, where $\param_1$ represents the thermal diffusion on the left-half and $\param_2$ is the $\kappa$ for the right half.

Two measurement locations along the rod are used for taking a measurement
We assume a uniform density for each observation with a side--length of $0.1$ and attempt to identify a set which contains our true reference value of $\paramref = (0.15, 0.05)$.
In Figure~\ref{fig:heatrod-sol-ex} we show the solution to this SIP for the set-- and sample--based methods for $N=50$ parameter samples used to explore $\pspace$.

\label{fig:heatrod-sol-ex}
\end{figure}

The experimental results in \ref{fig:heatrod-sol-ex} both show images which identify $\paramref$ as a feasible solution.
Both solutions again agree on the support of the inverse image.
We will look a the impacts of the sample size $\nsamps$ in the next chapter and study convergence towards a high-fidelity solution for different choices of measurement locations and values of $\paramref$.

[ TK - I don't know, there's not a whole lot to say. At this point I'm just establishing that both these methods are more or less equivalent despite having quite different algorithmic approaches.]
