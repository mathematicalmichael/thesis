\section{Conclusions}

We have shown that when posing and solving SIPs, we are motivated to choose data-constructed QoI maps which have (a) as many components as possible (up to the dimension of $\pspace$), and (b) whose components exhibit high-degrees of mutually geometrically distinct information (i.e., low average skewness).
There is a dramatic reduction in the sensitivity to the measurement noise when the same hundred measurements are used to construct a map with lower skewness.
In the next chapter, we discuss some other considerations for constructing SIPs, including measurement precision and placement.
We show how different experimental setups can lead to parameter estimates which exhibit different levels of accuracy and precision.
We also introduce a novel method for leveraging the results shown here in a sequential manner to gain possible computational efficiency.
