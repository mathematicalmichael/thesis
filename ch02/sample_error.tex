\subsection{Descriptions of Error}\label{sec:sample-error}

KDE is now the primary source, show relevant triangle inequality here.
Summarize Troy and Tim's work on the sensitivity analysis of everything.


Then, we have by repeated application of the triangle inequality that
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sample-triangleineq}
d(\PP_{\pspace, \ndiscs, \nsamps, h}, \paramP) \leq
\underset{ \text{(E1)} }{\underbrace{d(\PP_{\pspace, \ndiscs, \nsamps, h},\PP_{\pspace, \ndiscs, \nsamps})}} +
\underset{ \text{(E2)} }{\underbrace{d(\PP_{\pspace, \ndiscs, \nsamps}, \PP_{\pspace, \ndiscs}) }}+
\underset{ \text{(E3)} }{\underbrace{d(\PP_{\pspace, \ndiscs}, \paramP) }}.
\end{equation}
