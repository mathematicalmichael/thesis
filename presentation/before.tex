	Broad Goals of Uncertainty Quantification:
	\vskip 10pt
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item Make inferences and predictions
	    \vskip 20pt
        \item Quantify and reduce uncertainty (aleotoric, epistemic)
	    \vskip 20pt
	    \item Be \emph{accurate} and \emph{precise}
	    \vskip 20pt
	    \item Design ``efficient'' experiments
	    \vskip 20pt
	    \item Collect and use data ``intelligently''
    \end{itemize}

	\item State variable: $u$ {\color{gray}(e.g. heat, energy, pressure, deflection)}
	\vskip 10pt
	\item<.-> Parameters: $\lambda$ {\color{gray}(e.g. source term, diffusion, boundary data)}
	\vskip 10pt
		\item Deterministic model: $\mathcal{M} (u, \lambda) = 0$, $$\mathcal{M}:\lambda \to u(\lambda)$$

	\item Quantity of Interest map \tdeepred{(QoI)} - at least pcw differentiable \vskip 5pt
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Functional of the solution $$q: u(\lambda) \to \RR$$
		\item Can be vector valued $$Q = \mat{c}{q_1\\ q_2\\ \vdots \\ q_d}$$
		\item<.-> $Q(\lambda) := Q(u(\lambda))$
