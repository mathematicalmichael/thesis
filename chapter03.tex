\chapter{\uppercase{Data-Driven Maps and Consistent Inversion For Parameter Estimation} \label{chapter:04}}

TK - fill in. First, recall/summarize the comparisons in the introduction and that we now study the MUD as an alternative estimator to $\paramref$.

The main contributions of this chapter are as follows.
We extend the observation-consistent framework to solve problems involving epistemic uncertainties in model parameters.
This requires constructing QoI maps in an {\em a posteriori} fashion using noisy data, which is a novel way to define QoI maps in the observation-consistent framework.
The theory of existence, uniqueness, and convergence of maximal updated density (MUD) points are also provided for certain linear data-constructed QoI maps using typical assumptions found in the Bayesian literature.
Comparisons to other parameter estimates such as those obtained using a least-squares or Bayesian approach are also provided.
The applicability of the approach to nonlinear data-constructed QoI maps is also numerically demonstrated for ordinary and partial differential equation models of dynamical and stationary systems.
While there are several on-going and future research directions that are outside the scope of the current work, we do not wish to hide certain technical challenges in implementing this approach in certain scenarios.
We therefore address several technical challenges where appropriate to both point out these challenges as well as the heuristics we currently employ to handle these challenges.


The rest of this chapter is outlined as follows.
{\bf This is done last.}
