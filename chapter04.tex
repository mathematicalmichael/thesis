\chapter{\uppercase{Impact of Geometry of Output Quantities on Consistent Solutions} \label{chapter:geometry}}

Here, we motivate the reduction of a quantity called \emph{skewness} in pursuit of optimizing the geometry of solutions to SIPs with respect to their ability to be well-approximated with random sampling.
The results hold for any attempt to approximate densities defined on sets induced by random samples, and thus may be of interest to the larger research community.

\input{set-based/skewness.tex}

We demonstrate that the number of samples required to approximate densities using uniform i.i.d.~sampling is proportional to the skewness of the map used for inversion, though the convergence rate of the algorithm used to solve the SIP is unaffected.
We focus on the accuracy of the consistent solutions to the SIP.
It is illustrative to begin with the original set-based approximations to solutions developed in \cite{BGE+15, BET+14, MBD+15} as the dependence of solutions on skewness is more explicit than in the density-based approach.
While the content of this chapter is concerned with estimating distributions and not individual parameter estimates, we remind the reader that the solutions to the SIP are inherently densities.
In Chapter~\ref{chapter:mud}, we used these densities to produce a parameter estimate, and so we are motivated to study the accuracy of these solutions to the SIP.

\subsection{Convergence}
To study the accuracy of the solutions to SIPs using QoI maps with different skewness values (or number of available model evaluations), we need to select a metric on the space of probability measures.
Rates of convergence depend on this choice.
Since the spaces $\pspace$ we are considering are generally bounded and finite, the Total Variation metric metrizes weak convergence (see Thm. 6 in \cite{GS02}).
The latter property is of notable importance because the QoI maps we study are indeed (component-wise) functionals on the space of model inputs $\pspace$.
Thus, convergence of a sequence of probability measures under the Total Variation metric implies that the QoI's will also converge component-wise in $\RR$.
In other words, convergence in the Total Variation metric implies the convergence of the sampled QoI map to the exact QoI map since the map is a linear functional of the probability measure.
In other words, if $\PP_{\pspace,\ndiscs,\nsamps,h}$ converges to either $\PP_{\pspace,\ndiscs,\nsamps}$, $\PP_{\pspace,\ndiscs}$, or $P_\pspace$ using the Total Variation metric, this implies that the error converged to zero in the numerically computed $\qoi(\param^{(j)})$.
Thus, convergence in the Total Variation metric implies, in a sense, convergence of the numerical method used to construct the QoI map.
Furthermore, recall that weak convergence $\PP_n \to \PP$ is defined to mean
\[
\int f \PP_n \to \int f \PP \text{ as } n \to \infty
\]
for bounded Lipschitz functions $f:\pspace\to\RR$.
Taking $f = \Chi_A$, this leads to the following implication:
\[
\PP_{\pspace, \ndiscs, \nsamps} \to P_\pspace \implies \PP_{\pspace, \ndiscs, \nsamps} (A) \to P_\pspace (A) \quad \forall{A\in\pborel}.
\]
%provided we rigorously define $\P\PP_{\pspace, \ndiscs, \nsamps}$ to measure sets in $\BB_\pspace$, which we proceed to do in the following section\footnote{\bf{I know this is clumsy, but I'm not exactly sure how to phrase this correctly, because it almost seems like this would be true for all $A\in\pspace$ instead. I suppose the omission of the differential operator above is intentionally vague to gloss over this detail. Can we sharpen this up?}}
It is a combination of computational ease of implementation and theoretical implications that motivates the choice of the Total Variation as the metric used in the numerical results of Section \ref{sec:ch03-set} and \ref{sec:ch03-sample}.

\section{Conclusions}
In this chapter we introduced the skewness property of QoI maps and demonstrated that for solutions to the SIP, maps which exhibit lower values of skewness exhibit lower overall finite-sampling approximation error against a reference solution.
We saw that the solutions are invariant to transformations such as rotation (which also holds for translations).
The latter observation may aid in the selection of optimal maps (i.e., one can disregard the direction of the maps' contours and focus solely on the angles among the generalized contours).
In the following chapter, we show how the QoI maps in \ref{chapter:mud} constructed from measurements relate to the geometry of the resulting data-spaces and subsequently impacts the solutions to the SIP.
We demonstrate that an awareness of skewness can help construct maps which are more informative and thus increase the precision of parameter estimates.
