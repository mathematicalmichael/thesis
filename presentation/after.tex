  The random directions chosen on the left exhibit more redundancy than those on the right, so the same amount of iteration results in less accuracy.

You don't. But I enabled you to check for yourself.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Public repository hosted on Github.com ({\tt github.com/mathematicalmichael/thesis})
	\item Github Actions implements Continuous Integration / Deployment
	\item Each change is validated for reproducibility
	\item {\tt makefile} for convenience ({\tt make <filename>})
	\begin{itemize}
		\item dissertation (\LaTeX)
		\item presentation (beamer)
		\item every example, convergence result (Python)
		\item every image in every figure
	\end{itemize}
	\item Unit tests aid in ensuring integrity of functions
	\item PyPi published implementation of main methods: {\tt pip install mud}
	\item Docker guarantees software runtime (on {\tt x86}, {\tt armv8} forthcoming): \\ {\tt docker pull mathematicalmichael/python:thesis}({\tt latex:thesis})
\end{itemize}
