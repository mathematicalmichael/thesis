\section{Skewness and Information Content}
Here, we motivate the reduction of a quantity called \emph{skewness} in pursuit of optimizing the geometry of set-valued solutions to stochastic inverse problems with respect to their ability to be well-approximated by Monte-Carlo integration. 
However, the results hold for any attempt to approximate densities defined on sets induced by random samples, and thus may be of interest to the larger research community. 
We define a metric on the space of probability measures to demonstrate that the number of samples required to approximate densities using uniform i.i.d.~sampling is proportional to the skewness of the map used for inversion, though the convergence rate of the algorithm used to solve the stochastic inverse problem is unaffected.

\section{Accuracy of Sample-Based Inversion}

How does the new approach compare? What role does the KDE play in the error?
Focus on linear problems. One or two examples (perhaps use that skew-map with 1 and 2 and 4).

\
\section{Software Contributions}

Talk about the BET module that computes metrics.
Discuss testing, show sample of usage (disconnected from skewness, high-level).

\
\section{Numerical Results and Analysis}

Pick an ODE problem and show how the results look like (assimilating as many data points as inputs, if using time-series model). 

Our goal in this section is to provide a set of examples that demonstrate these two approaches, their ``solutions.''
Exponential Decay, uncertain initial condition and rate. Fix two measurement times. No OED discussion.

Show visualization of solution on voronoi-mesh vs. 2D density. 

This is going to set up the stage nicely.
What if we had more measurements to incorporate? Discuss how the distributions we imposed as our observed were kind of a little disingenuous since they were based on single measurements. Well, rather, they represent the answer to a different question.
