Bayesian approach: modeling epistemic uncertainties in data on a QoI obtained from a true, but unknown, parameter value, $\paramref$.

\vskip 10pt

\begin{defn}[Deterministic Forward Problem (DFP)]
  Given a space $\pspace$, and QoI map $\qoi$, the \emph{deterministic forward problem} is to determine the values, $\q \in \dspace$ that satisfy
  \begin{equation}
    \q = \qlam, \; \forall \; \param \in \pspace.
  \end{equation}
\end{defn}


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[t]{\it The one where we distinguish ourselves from the Bayesian Inverse Problem.}
\begin{defn}[Deterministic Inverse Problem (DIP) Under Uncertainty]
  Given a noisy datum (or data-vector) $d = \q + \xi$, $\q \in \dspace$, the \emph{deterministic inverse problem} is to determine the parameter $\param \in \pspace$ which minimizes
  \begin{equation}
    \norm{\qoi(\param) - d}
  \end{equation}
  where $\xi$ is a random variable (or vector) drawn from a distribution characterizing the uncertainty in observations due to measurement errors.
\end{defn}

In the above definition, $\xi$ is some unobservable perturbation to the true output, arising from epistemic uncertainty (e.g. the precision of available measurement equipment).

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[t]{\it The one where we distinguish ourselves from the Bayesian Inverse Problem.}
The \emph{posterior} is a conditional density, denoted by $\pi_\text{post}(\param\, | \, d)$, proportional to the product of the prior and data-likelihood function \cite{Walpole, Berger, Complete, Smith}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sb_post}
    \posterior\lam := \prior\lam \frac{L_\dspace (\q | \param)}{ C },
\end{equation}

\noindent where we emphasize the use of $\posterior$ to distinguish the \emph{posterior} from the updated density $\updated$ in \eqref{eq:updated-pdf}.

\emph{evidence} term $C$ ensures the posterior density integrates to one; given by
\[
C = \int_\pspace \prior\lam L_\dspace(\q | \param) \, d\param.
\]
