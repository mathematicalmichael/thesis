abstract="The multifidelity Monte Carlo method provides a general framework for combining cheap low-fidelity approximations of an expensive high-fidelity model to accelerate the Monte Carlo estimation of statistics of the high-fidelity model output. In this work, we investigate the properties of multifidelity Monte Carlo estimation in the setting where a hierarchy of approximations can be constructed with known error and cost bounds. Our main result is a convergence analysis of multifidelity Monte Carlo estimation, for which we prove a bound on the costs of the multifidelity Monte Carlo estimator under assumptions on the error and cost bounds of the low-fidelity approximations. The assumptions that we make are typical in the setting of similar Monte Carlo techniques. Numerical experiments illustrate the derived bounds.",

abstract = {Abstract We study the viscous Burgers' equation subject to perturbations on the boundary conditions. Two kinds of perturbations are considered: deterministic and random. For deterministic perturbations, we show that small perturbations can result in O(1) changes in the location of the transition layer. For random perturbations, we solve the stochastic Burgers' equation using different approaches. First, we employ the Jacobi-polynomial-chaos, which is a subset of the generalized polynomial chaos for stochastic modeling. Converged numerical results are reported (up to seven significant digits), and we observe similar ‘stochastic supersensitivity’ for the mean location of the transition layer. Subsequently, we employ up to fourth-order perturbation expansions. We show that even with small random inputs, the resolution of the perturbation method is relatively poor due to the larger stochastic responses in the output. Two types of distributions are considered: uniform distribution and a ‘truncated’ Gaussian distribution with no tails. Various solution statistics, including the spatial evolution of probability density function at steady state, are studied. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

    abstract = {The majority of structural damage and loss of life during a hurricane is due to storm surge, thus it is important for communities in hurricane-prone regions to understand their risk due to surge. Storm surge in particular is largely influenced by coastal features such as topography/bathymetry and bottom roughness. Bottom roughness determines how much resistance there is to the flow. Manning’s formula can be used to model the bottom stress with the Manning’s n coefficient, a spatially dependent field. Given a storm surge model and a set of model outputs, an inverse problem may be solved to determine probable Manning’s n fields to use for predictive simulations.The inverse problem is formulated and solved in a measure-theoretic framework using the state-of-the-art Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) storm surge model. The use of measure theory requires minimal assumptions and involves the direct inversion of the physics-based map from model inputs to output data determined by the ADCIRC model. Thus, key geometric relationships in this map are preserved and exploited. By using a recently available subdomain implementation of ADCIRC that significantly reduces the computational cost of forward model solves, the authors demonstrate the method on a case study using data obtained from an ADCIRC hindcast study of Hurricane Gustav (2008) to quantify uncertainties in Manning’s n within Bay St. Louis. However, the methodology is general and could be applied to any inverse problem that involves a map from model input to output quantities of interest.}

title = "Efficient collocational approach for parametric uncertainty analysis",
abstract = "A numerical algorithm for effective incorporation of parametric uncertainty into mathematical models is presented. The uncertain parameters are modeled as random variables, and the governing equations are treated as stochastic. The solutions, or quantities of interests, are expressed as convergent series of orthogonal polynomial expansions in terms of the input random parameters. A high-order stochastic collocation method is employed to solve the solution statistics, and more importantly, to reconstruct the polynomial expansion. While retaining the high accuracy by polynomial expansion, the resulting {"}pseudo-spectral{"} type algorithm is straightforward to implement as it requires only repetitive deterministic simulations. An estimate on error bounded is presented, along with numerical examples for problems with relatively complicated forms of governing equations.",
