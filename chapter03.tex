\chapter{\uppercase{Data-Driven Maps and Consistent Inversion For Parameter Estimation} \label{chapter:mud}}

The main contributions of this chapter are as follows.
We extend the observation-consistent framework to solve problems involving epistemic uncertainties in model parameters.
This requires constructing QoI maps in an {\em a posteriori} fashion using noisy data, which is a novel way to define QoI maps in the observation-consistent framework.
The theory of existence, uniqueness, and convergence of maximal updated density (MUD) points are also provided for linear data-constructed QoI maps using typical assumptions found in the Bayesian literature.
Comparisons to other parameter estimates such as those obtained using a least-squares or Bayesian approach are also provided.
The applicability of the approach to nonlinear data-constructed QoI maps is also numerically demonstrated for ordinary and partial differential equation models of dynamical and stationary systems.
While there are several on-going and future research directions that are outside the scope of this thesis, we do not wish to hide certain technical challenges in implementing this approach in certain scenarios.
We therefore address several technical challenges where appropriate to both point out these challenges as well as the heuristics we currently employ to handle these challenges.


The rest of this chapter is outlined as follows.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
We have demonstrated that the Data-Consistent framework can be used in order to cast a parameter-identification problem.
Much like how Hierarchical Bayesian approaches cast a distribution-estimation problem in a parameter-identification context, we have shown that the complement can also be accomplished.
Enabled by the definition of a particular form of QoI map which can incorporate an arbitrary stream of data, we can leverage a distribution-estimation framework to solve a parameter-identification problem.
To do so, we recast the problem of solving for a true parameter estimate into one involving the accurate identification of a distribution on the residuals errors predicted by a single parameter.
The role of the QoI was central in accomplishing this reformulation, as the distribution being estimated is a direct consequence of the statistical properties of the form of $\qoi$'s equation.

In Chapter~\ref{chapter:geometry}, we study in abstract the role of $\qoi$ on the solution to the SIP in the natural context of distribution-estimation.
We introduce measures of the QoI map's geometric properties that are directly related to our ability to accurately approximate the distribution using numerical approximation.
Later, in Chapter~\ref{chapter:vector-valued} we leverage this new awareness of the properties of the QoI maps and connect it to the goal of parameter identification in the context of the map \eqref{eq:qoi_WME}.
We will demonstrate that the way in which we use available data to construct $\qoi$ has a direct consequence on the accuracy of our parameter estimate as more data is incorporated as is hinted at by the last example above.
